- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
  The program felt more organized and easier to debug.
  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  Individually all the classes are working fine, but when I tried testing altogether, it didn't catch any exceptions. I'm not sure if my test code was wrong or if there's some other issue.
